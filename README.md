# Self-Balancing Robot üöÄ

This repository contains the design, implementation, and code for a **Self-Balancing Robot** built using an Arduino microcontroller, L298N motor driver, BO motors, MPU6050 sensor, and a lightweight foam board chassis. The project demonstrates the principles of robotics, control systems, and sensor integration.

## Project Overview üåü

The self-balancing robot mimics the balancing mechanism of humans, maintaining its stability on two wheels. By utilizing a **Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)** control algorithm and real-time orientation data from the MPU6050 sensor, the robot adjusts motor speeds dynamically to remain upright.

### Key Features:
- **PID Control**: Ensures stable balance by dynamically adjusting motor speed and direction.
- **MPU6050 Sensor**: Provides precise real-time orientation data.
- **Lightweight Design**: Foam board chassis offers a sturdy yet portable framework.
- **Iterative Tuning**: Optimized PID parameters (`Kp`, `Ki`, `Kd`) for efficient locomotion.

## Components Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **Arduino Uno**: Main microcontroller.
- **L298N Motor Driver**: Controls the BO motors.
- **BO Motors**: Provide mobility.
- **MPU6050 Sensor**: Measures orientation (yaw, pitch, roll).
- **Foam Board**: Frame and housing for components.
- Additional components: Wires, connectors, power supply.

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

1. **Orientation Detection**:  
   The MPU6050 sensor detects the robot's orientation (yaw, pitch, roll) and sends this data to the Arduino.

2. **PID Algorithm**:  
   The Arduino processes sensor data and calculates corrections using the PID algorithm.  
   - **Kp**: Proportional gain for immediate response.  
   - **Ki**: Integral gain for reducing steady-state error.  
   - **Kd**: Derivative gain for anticipating future errors.

3. **Motor Adjustment**:  
   The calculated corrections adjust the speed and direction of the motors via the L298N motor driver.

4. **Balancing**:  
   The robot continuously self-adjusts to maintain balance, even while moving.
